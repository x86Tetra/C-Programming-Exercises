---------------------- C Programming Exercises ----------------------

This repository is dedicated to my programming lectures in school,
more specifically after the approval of a language change from Python 
to the C programming language.

The course material that I have myself provided is "The C Programming 
Language, Second Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.
