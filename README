---------------------- C Programming Exercises ----------------------

This repository is dedicated to my programming lectures in school,
more specifically after the approval of a language change from Python 
to the C programming language.

The course material that I have myself provided is "The C Programming 
Language, Second Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

The following chapters in said book are:

-> Chapter 1: A Tutorial Introduction.

-> Chapter 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions.

-> Chapter 3: Control Flow.

-> Chapter 4: Functions and Program Structure.

-> Chapter 5: Pointers and Arrays.

-> Chapter 6: Structures.

-> Chapter 7: Input and Output.

-> Chapter 8: The UNIX System Interface.
